    DESIGN -
    Take a hard-coded robot Tic Tac Toe player, and put it up against a Genetic Algorithm equipped player.
    Have them player 100 games.
    ROBO-Player:  Can be toggled to go first or second.  Always plays in a certain sequence of moves, skipping a move and going to the next one if the current move is not valid.
    ANIMAL-Player:  Uses its current moveset to make a move.  If the move is not valid, skips to the next move.  If none of its moves are valid, makes a random move.

    BREEDING:  After each game, breed a certain number of players to form the next generation.

    EXPECTED RESULT:
    After 100 generations, the Best Animal Player should be able to destroy the robo-player.
